The game will start with the click of the Start button

First define global variables that reference html elements (queryselector or getelementbyID)

Then variables like wins/losses 

create an array of words that the user can guess (maybe themed?)


When clicking start, the program will choose a random word from the array and display its characters as underlines. 
Start by seeing if we can simply get the program to display the actual word

Eventually the chosen word will have to be seperated into characters so we can check each one against a keystroke 

Get it to display the word (can we use .textContent for this?)
and then to display the underlines
and then see if we can store the keystroke and maybe for loop it through the array of letters (how do we seperate a string of characters into individual ones)

eventlistener on Start button calls another function that:
chooses a random word from array(and saves that as a variable), breaks it into individual characters, and displays those characters as underlines
